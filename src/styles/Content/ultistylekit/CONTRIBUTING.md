# Contributing to UltiStyleKit

1. Start a discussion with the maintainers. One of our goals for UltiStyleKit
   is to maintain a small core stylesheet. Additions that only benefit your team
   will not be accepted into core, but might make a good addition to the USK
   Stash project as a component.
2. Fork USK/UltiStyleKit and add your changes to a new feature branch. Make
   sure to add automated tests where appropriate.
3. Open a Pull Request. Give a solid description of the problem and your
   proposed solution -- good enough that those unfamiliar with your prior
   discussions will be able to follow along. If possible, showcase your change
   either with a screenshot or an example implementation.
4. Be patient! UltiStyleKit is used on many products and platforms, so we must
   thoroughly review new changes.
